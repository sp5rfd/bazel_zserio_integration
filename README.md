Bazel-zSerio integration MVP
=

This is probably the simplest possible demo application that demonstrates zSerio (serialization framework & code generator) and Bazel (build tool) integration.

Usage

```
bazel run //:demo
```
This will download all required libs, generate source files, compile and run this program.
